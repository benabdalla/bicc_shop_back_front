# Upload System 403 Error Fix

## Problem
The upload endpoints are returning 403 Forbidden due to an expired JWT token being sent in requests.

## Root Cause
- JWT token expired on: 2025-10-11T20:21:51Z
- Current time: 2025-10-13T22:38:37Z
- The JWT filter is processing the expired token and throwing ExpiredJwtException
- Even though upload endpoints are whitelisted in SecurityConfig, the JWT filter runs BEFORE the authorization filter
- Filter chain order: JwtAuthFilter → AuthorizationFilter (where whitelist rules apply)

## Verification
✅ Upload endpoints work correctly when no JWT token is sent (tested with PowerShell)
✅ Security configuration is correct - endpoints are properly whitelisted
❌ Browser sends expired JWT token automatically, causing filter to fail

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Clear Browser Data (Quick Fix)
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Clear all localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies for localhost:4200
4. Or use browser incognito mode for testing

### Solution 2: Test Without Authorization Header
Use curl or a tool that doesn't automatically send stored tokens:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@your-image.jpg" http://localhost:8080/upload
```

### Solution 3: Fix JWT Filter (Recommended)
The JWT filter should handle expired tokens gracefully for whitelisted endpoints.

## Current Status
- Upload endpoints (/upload, /uploads/**) are correctly whitelisted in SecurityConfig
- JWT filter is catching expired tokens before security config is applied
- Need to either clear browser data or modify JWT filter to handle expired tokens gracefully

## Testing the Fix
1. Clear browser data or use incognito mode
2. Try uploading through the test page at /upload-test.html
3. Upload should work without authentication for the whitelisted endpoints
